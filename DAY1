Javascript Akshay Saini: 
Everything in js happens inside an "EXECUTION CONTEXT" which has two main component one is 'Memory' and another is 'Code'
js is synchronous(in sequence one after another) and single threaded(execute One at a time).
call stack maintains the order of execution of the "EXECUTION CONTEXT"
